## Notes and Considerations

- The system should maintain backward compatibility with existing strategies
- Each enhancement should be implemented with appropriate tests
- Regular performance benchmarking should be conducted
- Documentation should be updated in parallel with code changes
- All components should have clear error handling and logging

## Latest Updates (2025-03-15)

- Completed development of comprehensive test files for all key components
- Tests include validation of base regime detector, parameter integration, walk-forward testing framework, and pair stability monitoring
- Next steps: Execute tests and fix any identified issues before proceeding to the performance optimization phase
