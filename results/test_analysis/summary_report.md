## Trading Implications

Based on the cointegration analysis, we recommend focusing on pairs with:

1. Strong cointegration (low p-value in Engle-Granger and Johansen tests)
2. Stable hedge ratios (low standard deviation over time)
3. Reasonable half-life (between 5-30 days for daily trading)
4. High spread volatility (for better profit potential)

These pairs provide the best opportunity for statistical arbitrage strategies.
