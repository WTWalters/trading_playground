## Validation Experiments

### Experiment 1: Database Performance with TimescaleDB
- **Status**: Completed
- **Hypothesis**: TimescaleDB provides significant performance benefits for time-series queries compared to standard PostgreSQL
- **Test Procedure**: Benchmarked query performance for 1 month of stock data with various query patterns
- **Results**: TimescaleDB queries were 3-10x faster depending on the query type, with the highest gains on aggregations over time
- **Conclusion**: TimescaleDB is a suitable choice for the platform's time-series data needs

### Experiment 2: Yahoo Finance Data Provider Reliability
- **Status**: Completed
- **Hypothesis**: Yahoo Finance provider is reliable for daily OHLCV data
- **Test Procedure**: Fetched daily data for 5 major stocks over 1 year period and validated data integrity
- **Results**: 100% data completeness with no validation issues for daily data
- **Conclusion**: Yahoo Finance is a reliable provider for daily market data

## Known Issues

| Issue | Priority | Impact | Status | ETA |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Compression policy depends on TimescaleDB version | Medium | May need manual compression on some versions | Mitigated | N/A |
| Continuous aggregates refresh scheduling | Medium | May need manual refresh for optimal performance | Pending | N/A |

## Next Validation Priorities

1. Test correlation and cointegration analysis with real market data
2. Validate statistical signal generation on historical pairs
3. Benchmark performance with larger datasets (5+ years, 100+ symbols)
4. Test continuous aggregate query performance with different time buckets
5. Validate data integrity with split and dividend adjustments

## Notes & Documentation

- TimescaleDB version 2.17.2 is confirmed working with the current implementation
- Compatibility code has been added for compression and retention policies to handle version differences
- The DatabaseManager implementation is complete and fully functional
- Yahoo Finance integration is working for data ingestion
- Basic statistical analysis (volatility, returns, Sharpe ratio, correlations) is working
