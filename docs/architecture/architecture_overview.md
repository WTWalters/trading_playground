## Core Components

### 1. Data Infrastructure

The data infrastructure handles all aspects of market data:

- **Data Sources**: Interfaces with market data providers, alternative data sources, and synthetic data generation
- **Data Ingestion**: Collects, normalizes, and processes raw data
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality and consistency
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in TimescaleDB

**Key Design Decisions**:
- TimescaleDB chosen for optimized time-series storage and query performance
- Modular data source adapters for extensibility
- Event-driven ingestion architecture
- Data validation at multiple pipeline stages

### 2. Analysis Engine

The analysis engine implements the statistical models and algorithms:

- **Cointegration Analysis**: Identifies pairs with statistically significant relationships
- **Regime Detection**: Classifies market conditions into distinct regimes
- **Parameter Management**: Adapts strategy parameters based on market conditions
- **Signal Generation**: Creates trading signals based on statistical deviations

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Python-based statistical libraries (statsmodels, NumPy, pandas)
- Extensible regime classification framework
- Adaptive parameter management with hyper-optimization
- Modular signal generation pipeline

### 3. Portfolio Manager

The portfolio manager handles risk and position management:

- **Risk Controls**: Implements position-level and portfolio-level risk constraints
- **Position Sizing**: Determines optimal position sizes based on Kelly criterion and risk limits
- **Pair Selection**: Selects optimal pairs based on statistical properties
- **Diversification**: Ensures proper diversification across pairs and sectors

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Risk-first approach to portfolio construction
- Multiple constraint layers (strategy, sector, portfolio)
- Dynamic position sizing based on regime and volatility
- Correlation-aware diversification

### 4. Backtesting Engine

The backtesting engine validates strategies against historical data:

- **Strategy Validation**: Tests strategies against historical data
- **Performance Measurement**: Calculates performance metrics
- **Optimization**: Optimizes strategy parameters
- **Walk-forward Testing**: Validates strategies with out-of-sample testing

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Event-driven backtesting architecture
- Realistic simulation with slippage and transaction costs
- Integrated parameter optimization
- Time-series cross-validation (walk-forward) approach

### 5. Execution Engine

The execution engine handles trading operations:

- **Order Generation**: Converts signals to executable orders
- **Risk Checks**: Verifies compliance with risk limits
- **Execution Logic**: Handles order execution and management
- **Trade Monitoring**: Tracks order status and execution quality

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Paper trading capabilities for strategy validation
- Modular broker/exchange integration
- Comprehensive risk checks before execution
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### 6. Data Store

The data store provides persistent storage for all system components:

- **TimescaleDB**: Primary storage for time-series data
- **Event Store**: Records system events and actions
- **Parameter Store**: Maintains strategy parameters and configurations

**Key Design Decisions**:
- TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series optimization
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- Continuous aggregates for performance
- Data compression for storage efficiency

## Architectural Patterns
