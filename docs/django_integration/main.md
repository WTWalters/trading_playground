# TITAN Trading System Django Integration Architecture

## Document Structure

This Django integration architecture documentation is divided into multiple files for easier management and updates:

1. **[Executive Summary](executive_summary.md)** - Overview and goals of the Django integration
2. **[Project Structure](project_structure.md)** - Django project organization and architecture
3. **[Database Integration](database_integration.md)** - Model design and database configuration
4. **[API Layer](api_layer.md)** - REST API endpoints, serializers, and views
5. **[Service Layer](service_layer.md)** - Services bridging Django and trading components
6. **[WebSocket Integration](websocket_integration.md)** - Real-time data architecture
7. **[Frontend Integration](frontend_integration.md)** - Connecting Django with React frontend
8. **[Deployment Architecture](deployment_architecture.md)** - Production deployment considerations
9. **[Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md)** - Development phases and priorities

## Purpose and Scope

This architecture defines how to integrate our existing TITAN Trading System functionality with Django to create a web-based interface. The integration:

- Wraps existing Python modules within Django's framework
- Creates clean APIs for frontend interaction
- Maintains performance characteristics of the trading system
- Provides real-time data updates via WebSockets
- Establishes a secure, scalable application architecture

## Overview Diagram

```
React Frontend ⟷ Django REST API ⟷ Trading System Components ⟷ TimescaleDB
     ↑                  ↑                                           ↑
     └─────────────────┘                                           |
         WebSockets                                                |
                                                                   |
                           Redis (Cache/Channels/Celery) ←─────────┘
```

This modular architecture maintains separation of concerns while allowing each component to efficiently communicate with others through well-defined interfaces.
