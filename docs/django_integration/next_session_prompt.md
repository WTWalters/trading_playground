# Prompt for Next Session

Let's continue the Django implementation for the TITAN Trading System. In our last session, we completed a thorough code review and created a comprehensive implementation plan saved in `/docs/django_integration/implementation_plan.md`.

We're now ready to begin Phase 1 (Foundation) of our implementation plan:

1. **Django Project Setup**:
   - Create project structure following our documented approach
   - Configure settings for development
   - Update dependencies in pyproject.toml

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Implement the TimescaleRouter for dual database routing
   - Create the TimescaleModel base class
   - Configure database connections in settings

3. **Initial Models**:
   - Create core models for symbols, prices, and pairs
   - Set up migrations with TimescaleDB support
   - Implement user models with trading preferences

Please help me implement these components, focusing on:
- Creating the proper Django project structure
- Setting up the dual database configuration
- Implementing the core models that map to our existing data structures
- Ensuring compatibility with our existing TimescaleDB setup

Also, let's update our pyproject.toml with the necessary Django dependencies before starting the implementation.
