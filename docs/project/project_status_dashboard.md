## Executive Summary

The TITAN Trading System has successfully implemented all core components including data infrastructure, market analysis, and backtesting. The Django integration has progressed with the completion of Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Service Layer), though the service layer components still require testing. Current focus is on testing and validation of both the Django service layer and the adaptive parameter management system.

## Current Focus

The current sprint is focused on three main areas:

1. **Django Service Layer Testing**:
   - Creating unit tests for all service components
   - Testing async/sync bridging functionality
   - Validating error handling and resource management
   - Preparing for API implementation (Phase 3)

2. **Documentation Reorganization**:
   - Implementing the comprehensive documentation reorganization plan
   - Moving files to the appropriate directories
   - Adding cross-references between documents
   - Consolidating tracking documents

3. **Parameter Management Testing**:
   - Executing comprehensive tests for all parameter management components
   - Validating parameter adaptation across different market regimes
   - Documenting test results and optimization opportunities

## Recent Accomplishments

- Completed Django integration Phase 2 (Service Layer) implementation
- Created service components for all major system functions
- Implemented async/sync bridging for Django integration
- Fixed critical data source issues in backtesting engine
- Enhanced regime detection with macro indicators
- Created robust pipeline with error handling and fallbacks
- Developed comprehensive test suite for parameter management
- Implemented documentation directory structure and naming conventions

## Active Issues

- Django service layer components implemented but untested - @username - Target: End of March
- Parameter management testing suite developed but not fully executed - @username - Target: End of March
- Documentation reorganization in progress - @username - Target: End of March
- Parameter optimization needs validation - @username - Target: End of March

## Next Two Weeks

- Test Django service layer components
- Begin implementation of Django API layer (Phase 3)
- Complete documentation reorganization
- Execute all parameter management test suites and document results
- Begin implementation of performance optimization for parameter management
