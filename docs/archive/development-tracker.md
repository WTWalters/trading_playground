# TITAN Trading Platform - Development Tracker

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: Core Foundation** ✓ → **Phase 2: Strategy Development** ⟹

## Overall Progress
- [====================--] 80% Complete

## Recently Completed Components
- Database manager implementation with TimescaleDB features
- Data validation framework with quality metrics
- Yahoo Finance provider implementation
- Data orchestration system for ingestion pipeline
- TimescaleDB compression and retention policies
- Continuous aggregates for time-based queries
- Basic statistical analysis (volatility, returns, correlations)
- Proof-of-concept data pipeline demonstration

## Current Sprint Tasks

| Task | Assignee | Status | Due Date | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Pair selection algorithm | | Not Started | | Identify correlated and cointegrated pairs |
| Cointegration testing framework | | Not Started | | Implement ADF and Johansen tests |
| Mean reversion signal generator | | Not Started | | Z-score based signal generation |
| Position sizing module | | Not Started | | Risk-based position sizing |
| Backtesting engine core | | Not Started | | Trade simulation and metrics |

## Backlog Priorities
1. Statistical arbitrage models implementation
2. Regime detection system
3. Performance metrics and analytics dashboard
4. Backtesting engine enhancements
5. Portfolio optimization

## Known Issues & Blockers

| Issue | Impact | Potential Solution | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| TimescaleDB version compatibility | Medium | Added compatibility layer | Resolved |
| Data validation edge cases | Low | Enhance validation framework | Planned |
| Backtesting engine complexity | High | Start with simplified version | Planned |
| Strategy parameter optimization | Medium | Implement grid search approach | Planned |

## Next Milestone
**Complete Statistical Arbitrage Foundation (ETA: 2 weeks)**
- Implement pair selection algorithm
- Build cointegration testing framework
- Create mean-reversion signal generator
- Develop basic backtesting engine
- Implement position sizing logic
- Create statistical analysis notebook

## Notes & Decisions
- Database infrastructure is now complete and functional
- TimescaleDB is providing excellent performance for time-series queries
- Yahoo Finance is sufficient for daily data needs in development
- Moving forward with statistical arbitrage as the primary strategy
- Will focus on pair trading approach first, then expand to multi-asset
- Need to implement proper statistical validation for trading signals
