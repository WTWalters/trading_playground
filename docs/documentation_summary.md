# TITAN Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created main documentation categories (architecture, components, developer, user, project, testing, results, integration, archive)
   - Created component-specific subdirectories (data, analysis, backtesting, trading)

2. **Central Documentation Index**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation index at `/docs/index.md`
   - Organized documentation by category with clear links
   - Added placeholders for missing documents

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Implemented snake_case naming convention for all documentation files
   - Renamed key documentation files to follow conventions
   - Moved files to appropriate directories

4. **Documentation Types and Organization**:
   - Created templates for each document type
   - Added header sections with document type, last updated date, and related documents

5. **Cross-References**:
   - Added related documents sections to key files
   - Created cross-references between related documents
   - Added placeholder files for missing cross-referenced documents

6. **Project Tracking Consolidation**:
   - Consolidated information from NEXT_STEPS.md into development_roadmap.md
   - Updated project_status_dashboard.md with latest status
   - Moved legacy documents to archive directory

## Documentation Status

The documentation reorganization is approximately 75% complete. The basic structure and key files are in place, but the following tasks remain:

1. Complete cross-references between all documents
2. Fill in content for placeholder documents
3. Rename any remaining files that don't follow naming conventions
4. Review and update all documents for accuracy and completeness

## Using the Documentation

The main entry point for all documentation is now [index.md](./index.md). From there, you can navigate to any section of the documentation. The [README.md](./README.md) in the docs directory provides an overview of the documentation structure and guidelines for maintaining it.

## Verifying Documentation

A script has been created to verify cross-references between documents. Run the following command to check for broken links:

```bash
python scripts/check_links.py
```

This will identify any broken links between documents, which can then be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the content for placeholder documents
2. Update README.md with more comprehensive information
3. Add more cross-references between related documents
4. Review all documents for accuracy and completeness
