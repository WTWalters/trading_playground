# Performance Metrics for LLM Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM integration in the TITAN trading platform. These metrics are designed to track improvements in trading performance and validate that the LLM integration delivers measurable benefits.

## Market Regime Analysis Metrics

### 1. Regime Classification Accuracy

**Definition:** Percentage of correct regime classifications compared to human expert labels or future market behavior.

**Calculation:**
```
Accuracy = (Correct Classifications / Total Classifications) * 100
```

**Target:** >75% accuracy, with 10% improvement over baseline statistical methods.

**Tracking:** Weekly comparison between LLM-enhanced and baseline regime detection.

### 2. Transition Detection Speed

**Definition:** How many trading days earlier the system can detect regime transitions.

**Calculation:**
```
Speed Improvement = (Baseline Detection Day - Enhanced Detection Day)
```

**Target:** Average improvement of 2+ trading days for major transitions.

**Tracking:** For each detected transition, compare when the baseline system vs. the enhanced system first identified the change.

### 3. Parameter Optimization Improvement

**Definition:** Performance improvement of strategies using LLM-enhanced regime detection for parameter optimization.

**Calculation:**
```
Performance Delta = (Enhanced Strategy Performance - Baseline Strategy Performance)
```
Where performance can be measured using Sharpe ratio, total return, or maximum drawdown.

**Target:** 15% improvement in risk-adjusted returns.

**Tracking:** Compare backtest results with and without LLM enhancement.

### 4. Contextual Awareness Score

**Definition:** System's ability to incorporate news and external events into regime classifications.

**Calculation:** Percentage of major market-moving events correctly incorporated into regime analysis.

**Target:** >80% of significant market events reflected in regime analysis.

**Tracking:** Manually review regime transitions against known market-moving events.

## Trade Post-Mortem Metrics

### 1. Win Rate Improvement

**Definition:** Increase in win rate after implementing post-mortem insights.

**Calculation:**
```
Win Rate Delta = (Post-Implementation Win Rate - Pre-Implementation Win Rate)
```

**Target:** Minimum 5% absolute improvement in win rate over 90 days.

**Tracking:** Compare win rates before and after implementing post-mortem suggestions.

### 2. Risk-Reward Optimization

**Definition:** Improvement in the average risk-reward ratio of trades.

**Calculation:**
```
Risk-Reward Delta = (Post-Implementation R:R - Pre-Implementation R:R)
```

**Target:** 20% improvement in risk-reward ratio.

**Tracking:** Compare average R:R ratios before and after implementation.

### 3. Drawdown Reduction

**Definition:** Reduction in maximum drawdown percentage.

**Calculation:**
```
Drawdown Improvement = (Pre-Implementation Max DD - Post-Implementation Max DD)
```

**Target:** 15% reduction in maximum drawdown.

**Tracking:** Compare drawdowns in equivalent market conditions.

### 4. Pattern Recognition Accuracy

**Definition:** How accurately identified patterns predict future trade outcomes.

**Calculation:**
```
Pattern Accuracy = (Correct Pattern Predictions / Total Pattern Identifications) * 100
```

**Target:** >70% prediction accuracy for identified patterns.

**Tracking:** For each identified pattern, track how often the predicted outcome occurs.

### 5. Learning Implementation Rate

**Definition:** How frequently traders implement suggestions from post-mortems.

**Calculation:**
```
Implementation Rate = (Implemented Suggestions / Total Suggestions) * 100
```

**Target:** >60% implementation rate for high-confidence suggestions.

**Tracking:** Tag suggestions in the system and track implementation status.

## Target Success Criteria

The LLM integration will be considered successful if, within 90 days:
1. Win rate increases by at least 5% absolute percentage
2. Risk-reward ratio improves by at least 20%
3. Drawdowns decrease by at least 15%
4. Regime transitions are detected at least 2 days earlier on average
