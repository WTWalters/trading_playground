# Market Regime Analysis Enhancement

## Overview

The Market Regime Analysis Enhancement integrates LLM capabilities with the existing statistical regime detection system to provide deeper contextual understanding of market conditions based on news, economic reports, and other textual data.

## Components

### 1. News Data Provider

Extension of the existing data provider architecture to include financial news sources. Key features:
- Abstract base class for news data providers
- Implementation for specific news APIs (Alpha Vantage, Financial Times, etc.)
- News storage in TimescaleDB with full-text search capabilities
- Sentiment analysis and entity extraction

### 2. LLM Regime Analyzer

Integration of LLM analysis with the Enhanced Regime Detector:
- Contextual analysis of market news and reports
- Identification of regime transitions based on qualitative factors
- Combined scoring system for statistical and LLM-based regime detection
- Specialized analysis for economic reports and Fed statements

### 3. Database Schema

Extensions to store:
- News articles and associated metadata
- LLM analysis results
- Enhanced regime classifications
- Entity and topic mappings

## Implementation Details

### LLM Integration Points

The LLM integration enhances the existing EnhancedRegimeDetector in these ways:
- Pre-detection: Analyzing news before statistical detection for priming
- Post-detection: Refining statistical detection with contextual information
- Transition detection: Identifying early signs of regime transitions
- Confidence scoring: Adding confidence metrics based on multiple sources

### Prompt Engineering

Carefully designed prompts for different analysis types:
- General regime classification
- Fed statement analysis
- Earnings call interpretation
- Economic report assessment
- Market turning point detection

### Testing and Validation

- Historical accuracy testing against known regime transitions
- Comparison of LLM-enhanced vs. baseline regime detection
- Backtesting performance with parameter adjustments based on enhanced detection

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the LLM-enhanced regime detector
regime_analyzer = LLMRegimeAnalyzer(db_manager, config)

# Get enhanced regime classification
result = await regime_analyzer.enhance_regime_detection(market_data, macro_data)

# Analyze a specific document (e.g., Fed statement)
fed_analysis = await regime_analyzer.analyze_specific_document(
    document_type="fed_statement",
    document_content=fed_statement_text,
    document_metadata={"date": statement_date, "source": "Federal Reserve"}
)

# Check for potential market turning points
turning_point = await regime_analyzer.detect_market_turning_points(market_data)
```

## Performance Metrics

The effectiveness of the LLM enhancement is measured by:
- Regime classification accuracy vs. human expert labels
- Earlier detection of regime transitions (measured in days)
- Reduction in false positives/negatives for regime changes
- Improved trading performance using LLM-enhanced regime detection
